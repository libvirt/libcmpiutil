       libcmpiutil : A CMPI toolkit library for writing providers

Libcmpiutil is a library of utility functions for CMPI providers.  It
is free software available under the GNU Lesser General Public
License.  The goal is to reduce the amount of repetitive work done in
most CMPI providers by encapsulating common procedures with more
"normal" APIs.  This extends from operations like getting typed
instance properties to standardizing method dispatch and argument
checking.

The latest version of the library can be found here:

 Development discussion currently takes place on the libvirt-cim
 mailing list:
